# G2M-Cab-Investment    

__This is the repository for the G2M Case Study as part of the deliverables for the Data Glacier Internship.__

We have been asked by XYZ to perform profit and cost analysis on 2 companies (Yellow and Pink Cabs). Based on the provided datasets, a master dataset was created in order to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and find the required patterns in the data that would help in making a recommendation to the executives of XYZ. 5 meaningful hypotheses were chosen and hypothesis testing was performed to see if the data had enough statistical evidence to accept the hypotheses. All the relavant findings were reported in a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation.
